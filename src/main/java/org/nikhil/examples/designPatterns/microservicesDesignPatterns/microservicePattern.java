public class microservicePattern {
    //Here is a brief overview of common microservices design patterns:
    //
    // ** 1. Decomposition Patterns **
    //- **Decompose by Business Capability:** Split services based on business functions.
    //  This pattern focuses on breaking down the system into services that align with specific business capabilities.
    //  Each service is responsible for a distinct business function, allowing for better alignment with business goals.
    //  Example: An e-commerce application might have separate services for user management, product catalog, and order processing.
    //  Implementation: Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently,
    //  allowing teams to work on different services concurrently without affecting each other.

    //- **Decompose by Subdomain:** Use domain-driven design to identify bounded contexts.
    //  This pattern applies domain-driven design principles to identify subdomains within the business domain.
    //  Each subdomain can be implemented as a separate service, allowing for better separation of concerns and autonomy.
    //  Example: In a banking application, you might have separate services for account management, transaction processing, and customer support.
    //  Implementation: Each service can have its own data model and business logic, allowing for flexibility in implementation and evolution over time.
    //
    // ** 2. Integration Patterns**
    //- **API Gateway:** Single entry point for clients, routing requests to appropriate services.
    //  This pattern provides a unified interface for clients to interact with multiple services.
    //  The API Gateway acts as a reverse proxy, routing requests to the appropriate service based on the request path or other criteria.
    //  It can also handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and rate limiting.
    //  Example: An API Gateway can route requests for user profiles, product details, and order processing to their respective services.
    //  Implementation: The API Gateway can be implemented using tools like Spring Cloud Gateway, Kong, or Nginx.
    //  It can also provide features like request aggregation, where it combines responses from multiple services into a single response for the client.
    //  Example: An API Gateway can aggregate responses from user service, product service, and order service
    //  to provide a consolidated response to the client, reducing the number of round trips required.

    //- **Service Registry:** Keeps track of available services and their instances.
    //  This pattern maintains a registry of all available services and their instances.
    //  It allows services to discover each other dynamically, enabling load balancing and failover.
    //  The service registry can be implemented using tools like Eureka, Consul, or Zookeeper.
    //  Example: When a new instance of a service starts, it registers itself with the service registry,
    //  allowing other services to discover it and route requests accordingly.
    //  Implementation: The service registry can be implemented using tools like Eureka, Consul, or Zookeeper.

    // Feign Client: Simplifies HTTP client calls to other services.
    //  This pattern provides a declarative way to define HTTP clients for calling other services.
    //  It allows developers to define service interfaces with annotations, and Feign generates the necessary HTTP client code.
    //  Feign clients can be used in conjunction with service discovery to dynamically resolve service instances.
    //  Example: A Feign client can be used to call a user service to fetch user details or an order service to place an order.
    //  Implementation: Feign clients can be defined using annotations like `@FeignClient` in Spring Cloud,
    //  which automatically generates the necessary HTTP client code based on the defined interface.

    //- **Client-Side Load Balancing:** Clients choose which service instance to call.
    //  This pattern allows clients to select which instance of a service to call based on load balancing algorithms.
    //  It can be implemented using libraries like Ribbon or Spring Cloud LoadBalancer.
    //  The client retrieves the list of available service instances from the service registry and selects one based on the chosen algorithm.
    //  Example: A client can use round-robin or random selection to distribute requests across multiple instances of a service.

    //- **Server-Side Load Balancing:** Load balancer routes requests to service instances.
    //  This pattern uses a load balancer to distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of a service.
    //  The load balancer can be implemented using tools like Nginx, HAProxy, or cloud-based load balancers.
    //  It routes requests based on various algorithms like round-robin, least connections, or IP hash.
    //  Example: A load balancer can route requests to multiple instances of a service running on different servers,
    //  ensuring that no single instance is overwhelmed with requests.

    //- **Service Discovery:** Enables services to find each other dynamically.
    //  This pattern allows services to discover each other at runtime without hardcoding service endpoints.
    //  It can be implemented using a service registry or through client-side discovery mechanisms.
    //  Example: A service can query the service registry to find the available instances of another service
    //  and route requests to one of them based on load balancing algorithms.

    //- **Aggregator:** Combines responses from multiple services into one.
    //  This pattern aggregates data from multiple services into a single response for the client.
    //  It can be implemented using an API Gateway or a dedicated aggregator service.
    //  The aggregator service makes parallel calls to multiple services, collects their responses,
    //  and combines them into a single response before returning it to the client.
    //  Example: An aggregator service can fetch user profile data, order history, and product recommendations
    //  from their respective services and return a consolidated response to the client.
    //
    //** 3. Database Patterns**
    //- **Database per Service:** Each service manages its own database.
    //- **Shared Database:** Multiple services share a single database (generally discouraged).
    //  This pattern allows multiple services to access a common database, enabling data sharing and consistency.
    //  However, it can lead to tight coupling between services and is generally discouraged in microservices architectures.
    //  If a shared database is used, it is important to ensure that services do not interfere with each other's data models
    //  and that changes to the database schema are carefully managed to avoid breaking other services.
    //
    //** 4. Communication Patterns **
    //- **Synchronous (REST/gRPC):** Direct service-to-service calls.
    //- **Asynchronous (Messaging/Event-Driven):** Services communicate via message brokers (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka).
    //
    //** 5. Reliability Patterns **
    //- **Circuit Breaker:** Prevents cascading failures by stopping calls to a failing service.
    //  This pattern allows the system to recover gracefully.
    //  It monitors the health of service calls and opens the circuit when failures exceed a threshold.
    //  Once the circuit is open, calls to the service are not made until it is deemed healthy again.
    //  This helps maintain system stability and prevents overload on failing services.
    //  Example: If a payment service is down, the circuit breaker prevents further calls to it,
    //  allowing the system to return a fallback response or an error message to the client.

    //- **Fallback:** Provides a default response when a service is unavailable.
    //  This pattern allows the system to return a predefined response or execute an alternative logic
    //  when a service call fails. It ensures that the system can still function, albeit with limited capabilities.
    //  Fallbacks can be implemented at the service level or using a circuit breaker pattern.
    //  Example: If a user profile service is down, the system can return a cached version of the user profile
    //  or a default response instead of failing the entire request.

    //- **Load Balancing:** Distributes requests across multiple service instances.
    //  This pattern helps to evenly distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of a service,
    //  improving performance and availability. It can be implemented using various algorithms like round-robin,
    //  least connections, or IP hash.
    //  Load balancing can be done at the network level (e.g., using a load balancer) or at the application level
    //  (e.g., using client-side load balancing).
    //  Example: If a service has multiple instances running, the load balancer will route requests to these instances
    //  based on the chosen algorithm, ensuring that no single instance is overwhelmed with requests.
    //  This helps to improve the overall performance and reliability of the service.

    //- **Service Mesh:** Manages service-to-service communication, providing features like load balancing,
    //  security, and observability. A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer that handles
    //  communication between services. It abstracts the complexity of service interactions and provides
    //  features like traffic management, security (e.g., mutual TLS), and observability (e.g., tracing and metrics).
    //  This pattern is particularly useful in microservices architectures where services need to communicate
    //  with each other frequently and require robust management of those interactions.
    //  Example: Istio and Linkerd are popular service mesh implementations that provide these capabilities.

    //- **Rate Limiting:** Controls the number of requests a service can handle in a given time.
    //  This pattern helps to protect services from being overwhelmed by too many requests.
    //  It limits the number of requests from a client or across all clients to ensure fair usage and prevent abuse.
    //  Rate limiting can be implemented using various algorithms like token bucket, leaky bucket, or fixed window.
    //  Example: If a service allows 100 requests per minute, any requests beyond that limit will be rejected
    //  or delayed, ensuring that the service remains responsive and available to all clients.

    //- **Timeout:** Sets a maximum time for service calls to prevent hanging requests.
    //  This pattern ensures that service calls do not block indefinitely, allowing the system to recover from slow or unresponsive services.
    //  It specifies a timeout duration for each service call, after which the call is aborted,
    //  and an error response is returned to the client or calling service.
    //  This helps to maintain responsiveness and prevents resource exhaustion in the system.
    //  Example: If a service call takes longer than the specified timeout, it will be aborted,
    //  and the system can return a fallback response or an error message to the client.


    //- **Retry:** Automatically retries failed requests.
    //  This pattern allows the system to attempt a service call multiple times before giving up.
    //  It is useful for handling transient failures, such as network issues or temporary service unavailability.
    //  The retry logic can be configured with exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the service with retries.
    //  Exponential backoff is a strategy where the wait time between retries increases exponentially,
    //  which helps to reduce the load on the service and increases the chances of a successful response on subsequent attempts.
    //  Example: If a service call fails, it can be retried up to three times with increasing wait times between attempts.

    //- **Bulkhead:** Isolates failures to prevent them from affecting the whole system.
    //  This pattern divides the system into isolated components or "bulkheads" to contain failures.
    //  If one component fails, it does not impact the others, allowing the system to continue functioning.
    //  This is particularly useful in microservices architectures where services can fail independently.
    //  Example: If a payment service fails, it should not affect the user profile service.

    //
    //**6. Observability Patterns**
    //- **Log Aggregation:** Centralizes logs from all services.
    //- **Distributed Tracing:** Tracks requests across service boundaries.
    //
    //**7. Deployment Patterns**
    //- **Service Discovery:** Dynamically locates service instances.
    //- **Sidecar:** Deploys helper components alongside services (e.g., for logging, monitoring).
    //
    //These patterns help build scalable, resilient, and maintainable microservices architectures.
