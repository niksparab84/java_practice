    //How to handle distributed transactions in microservices architecture?
    //Distributed transactions can be handled using two-phase commit (2PC) or compensating transactions.
    //Two-phase commit ensures that all services involved in the transaction either commit or rollback together.
    //Compensating transactions involve creating a series of compensating actions that can be executed to undo the effects of a transaction if it fails.
    //However, both approaches have their own challenges and trade-offs.

    //Two-phase commit (2PC) is a protocol that ensures all participants in a distributed transaction either commit or rollback together.
    //It involves two phases: the prepare phase and the commit phase.
    //In the prepare phase, each participant votes on whether it can commit or not.
    //If all participants vote to commit, the transaction proceeds to the commit phase where all participants commit the transaction.
    //If any participant votes to rollback, the transaction is rolled back across all participants.
    //Compensating transactions involve creating a series of compensating actions that can be executed to undo the effects of a transaction if it fails.
    //This approach is often used in microservices architectures where services are loosely coupled and may not support distributed transactions.
    //In practice, distributed transactions can be complex and may require careful design and implementation.
    //In microservices architecture, distributed transactions can be handled using two-phase commit (2PC) or compensating transactions.

    //In e-commerce applications, distributed transactions can be used to ensure that all services involved in a transaction (e.g., inventory, payment, shipping) either commit or rollback together.
    //For example, if a customer places an order, the inventory service may need to reserve stock, the payment service may need to process payment, and the shipping service may need to schedule delivery.
    //However, if any of these services fail, the entire transaction should be rolled back to ensure data consistency.
    //What if the payment service fails after the inventory service has reserved stock?
    //In such cases, compensating transactions can be used to undo the effects of the transaction.
    //For example, if the payment service fails after the inventory service has reserved stock, a compensating transaction can be created to release the reserved stock.
    //This ensures that the inventory service is not left with reserved stock that cannot be sold, and the payment service is not left with a failed transaction.
    //Design patterns like Saga or Event Sourcing can also be used to manage distributed transactions in microservices architecture.

    //Saga pattern involves breaking down a distributed transaction into smaller, independent transactions that can be executed in a sequence.
    //Each transaction in the saga can be compensated if it fails, allowing the overall transaction to be rolled back.
    //For example, in an e-commerce application, a saga can be used to manage the order placement process.
    //The saga can consist of multiple steps, such as reserving stock, processing payment, and scheduling delivery.
    //If any of these steps fail, the saga can execute compensating actions to undo the effects of the previous steps.
    //Event Sourcing involves capturing the state of an application as a sequence of events.
    //In a distributed transaction, each service can publish events to indicate the state of the transaction.
    //For example, when a customer places an order, the inventory service can publish an event indicating that stock has been reserved,
    //the payment service can publish an event indicating that payment has been processed, and the shipping service can publish an event indicating that delivery has been scheduled.
    //If any of these services fail, the events can be used to reconstruct the state of the transaction and execute compensating actions if necessary.
    //In summary, distributed transactions in microservices architecture can be handled using two-phase commit (2PC), compensating transactions, Saga pattern, or Event Sourcing.

    //What is event sourcing?
    //Event Sourcing is a design pattern where the state of an application is captured as a sequence of events.
    //Instead of storing the current state of an application, Event Sourcing stores all the events that have occurred in the application.
    //Each event represents a change in the state of the application, and the current state can be reconstructed by replaying the events in order.
    //Event Sourcing is often used in conjunction with Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) to separate the read and write operations of an application.
    //In a distributed transaction, each service can publish events to indicate the state of the transaction.
    //For example, when a customer places an order, the inventory service can publish an event indicating that stock has been reserved,
    //the payment service can publish an event indicating that payment has been processed, and the shipping service can publish an event indicating that delivery has been scheduled.
    //If any of these services fail, the events can be used to reconstruct the state of the transaction and execute compensating actions if necessary.
    //In summary, Event Sourcing is a design pattern that captures the state of an application as a sequence of events,
    //allowing the current state to be reconstructed by replaying the events in order.
    //In e-commerce applications, Event Sourcing can be used to track the state of orders, inventory, and payments.
    //For example, when a customer places an order, the application can publish events indicating that stock has been reserved,
    //payment has been processed, and delivery has been scheduled.
    //This allows the application to reconstruct the state of the order at any point in time and provides a complete audit trail of all changes made to the order.

    //In e-commerce application, what if the payment service fails after the inventory service has reserved stock?
    //In such cases, compensating transactions can be used to undo the effects of the transaction.
    //For example, if the payment service fails after the inventory service has reserved stock, a compensating transaction can be created to release the reserved stock.
    //This ensures that the inventory service is not left with reserved stock that cannot be sold, and the payment service is not left with a failed transaction.

    //What if the payment service is down and we don't want to lose business?
    //In such cases, we can use a retry mechanism to retry the payment service after a certain interval.
    //This can be implemented using a message queue or a scheduled task that retries the payment service after a certain interval.
    //For example, if the payment service is down, the application can publish an event indicating that the payment service is unavailable.
    //The application can then retry the payment service after a certain interval, such as 5 minutes.
    //This allows the application to continue processing orders without losing business, while also ensuring that the payment service is eventually retried.

    //In summary, distributed transactions in microservices architecture can be handled using two-phase commit (2PC), compensating transactions, Saga pattern, or Event Sourcing.
    //How to Use notification services in e-commerce applications?
    //Notification services can be used in e-commerce applications to send notifications to customers about their orders, such as order confirmation, shipping updates, and delivery notifications.
    //For example, when a customer places an order, the application can send a notification to the customer indicating that the order has been placed successfully.
    //This can be implemented using a notification service that sends notifications via email, SMS, or push notifications.
    //In addition, notification services can also be used to send notifications to customers about promotions, discounts, and new products.
    //For example, when a new product is added to the inventory, the application can send a notification to customers who have subscribed to receive notifications about new products.
    //This allows the application to keep customers informed about their orders and promotions, while also providing a better customer experience.
    //In summary, notification services can be used in e-commerce applications to send notifications to customers about their orders, promotions, and new products.


    // High level design of distributed transaction in microservices architecture:
    // 1. Identify the services involved in the transaction: In an e-commerce application, the services involved in a distributed transaction may include inventory service, payment service, and shipping service.
    // 2. Define the transaction boundaries: The transaction boundaries should be defined to ensure that all services involved in the transaction either commit or rollback together.
    // 3. Implement two-phase commit (2PC) or compensating transactions: Two-phase commit (2PC) can be used to ensure that all services involved in the transaction either commit or rollback together.
    // Alternatively, compensating transactions can be used to undo the effects of a transaction if it fails.
    // 4. Use Saga pattern or Event Sourcing: Saga pattern can be used to manage distributed transactions by breaking down a distributed transaction into smaller, independent transactions that can be executed in a sequence.
    // Event Sourcing can be used to capture the state of an application as a sequence of events, allowing the current state to be reconstructed by replaying the events in order.
    // 5. Implement notification services: Notification services can be used to send notifications to customers about their orders, promotions, and new products.
    // 6. Implement retry mechanism: A retry mechanism can be implemented to retry the payment service after a certain interval if it fails.
    // 7. Monitor and log the distributed transaction: Monitoring and logging can be implemented to track the state of the distributed transaction and identify any issues that may arise.
    // 8. Test the distributed transaction: The distributed transaction should be tested to ensure that it works as expected and that all services involved in the transaction either commit or rollback together.
    // 9. Deploy the distributed transaction: The distributed transaction can be deployed to production after testing and validation.
    // 10. Monitor the distributed transaction in production: Monitoring can be implemented to track the state of the distributed transaction in production and identify any issues that may arise.
    // 11. Handle failures and rollbacks: If any service involved in the distributed transaction fails, the transaction should be rolled back to ensure data consistency.
    // 12. Document the distributed transaction: The distributed transaction should be documented to ensure that it can be maintained and updated in the future.
    // 13. Continuously improve the distributed transaction: The distributed transaction should be continuously improved based on feedback and performance metrics to ensure that it meets the needs of the application and its users.
    // 14. Ensure security and compliance: Security and compliance should be considered when implementing distributed transactions to ensure that sensitive data is protected and that the application meets regulatory requirements.
    // 15. Use appropriate tools and frameworks: There are various tools and frameworks available for implementing distributed transactions in microservices architecture, such as Spring Cloud, Axon Framework, and Apache Camel.
    // 16. Consider scalability and performance: The distributed transaction should be designed to handle high traffic and large volumes of data, while also ensuring that it performs well under load.
    // 17. Use appropriate design patterns: Design patterns such as Circuit Breaker, Bulkhead, and Retry can be used to improve the resilience and reliability of the distributed transaction.
    // 18. Use appropriate data storage: The data storage used for the distributed transaction should be chosen based on the requirements of the application, such as scalability, performance, and consistency.
    // 19. Use appropriate communication protocols: The communication protocols used for the distributed transaction should be chosen based on the requirements of the application, such as scalability, performance, and reliability.
